                    <h3>How old do I need to be to rent a car</h3>
                    <p>
                        You must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and any driver under 25 may have to pay a Young Driver Fee. Similarly, people aged 70+ will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent to them at all.

                    <h3>Can I book a one-way car rental? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes. One-way car rental deals are quite common, as they give people even more freedom to explore and enjoy their rental.However, Ypu will charge a One Way Fee to cover the cost of returning the car to its original location.
